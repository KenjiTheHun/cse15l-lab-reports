# How to establish remote access on your laptop for CSE15L.
## Step 1: Installing Visual Studio Codes
Our very first step to connecting your laptop to the lab computers is to install VSCode on your computer. This will be your activities hub for coding. 

Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the whichever installer you need for you OS. I won't be providing any screenshots for this step as I already have VSCode installed on my laptop. The installation is very straightforward and should give no issues. Once it's finished downloading we'll move on to establishing remote accesss.

## Step 2: Establishing Remote Access
Congratulations! You've made it to the most **crucial** step. There is something to do, however, if you're on **Windows**; Mac users can skip this step. To ensure that everything works properly, install git for Windows:

[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

Once that is done, follow the steps in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994) to set your terminal in VSCode to use *git bash*.
